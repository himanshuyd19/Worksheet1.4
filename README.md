# Storing data of file to another by using readfile and writefile .

# Aim/Overview:
* Initialize Git Repository: Set up a Git repository for your project to track changes.
* Commit and Push: Add your project files, commit changes, and push them to a remote repository.
* Create README: Generate a README file in your project directory.
* Document: Populate the README with details including its purpose and methodology.

# Algorithm/Flowchart :
* Initialize Git Repository:
Use git init to create a new Git repository in your project directory.
* Stage Project Files:
Use git add to stage the project files you want to track.
* Commit Changes:
Execute git commit -m "Initial commit" to save the staged changes with a meaningful message.
* Create a Remote Repository:
Create a new repository on a Git hosting platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
* Connect Local and Remote Repositories:
Link your local repository to the remote one using git remote add origin <remote-repository-url>.
* Push Code to Remote:
Push your local code to the remote repository with git push -u origin master (adjust branch name if needed).
* Generate a README File:
Create a README file in your project directory, e.g., touch README.md.
* Edit and Document Experiment 1.2.1:
Edit the README.md file to include detailed information about Experiment 1.2.1, such as its aim, methodology, and relevant details.

# Now, let's create a README file to provide information about my employee salary calculator project. A good README typically includes the following sections: 
1. Project Title:- A clear and concise title for your project. 
2. Description:- A brief overview of what your project does. In this case, it's an employee salary calculator using Node.js. 
3. Table of Contents:- List of sections or headings in your README.
4. Installation:- Instructions on how to install any dependencies and run your project. 
5. Usage:- Instructions on how to use your employee salary calculator. 
6. Contributing:- Guidelines for contributing to your project (if applicable). 
7. License:- Information about the license your project is under (e.g., MIT License). 
8. Authors:- List of project contributors.

# Learning outcomes
1. Git Proficiency:
You'll acquire essential Git skills, including repository initialization, version tracking, and collaboration using remote repositories.
